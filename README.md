This project leverages machine learning to predict housing prices in the Boston area using historical data. By analyzing key features such as crime rates, average number of rooms, and socioeconomic status, we develop and compare various models, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
