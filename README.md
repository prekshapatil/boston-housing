# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts housing prices in the Boston area using machine learning. Key factors like crime rates, average number of rooms, and socioeconomic data are analyzed using models such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing: Missing value handling, scaling, and outlier detection.
- Feature engineering: Polynomial features and PCA.
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and \( R^2 \).
- Ethical considerations in using sensitive data.
